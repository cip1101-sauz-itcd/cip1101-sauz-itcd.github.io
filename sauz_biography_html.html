    <h2><em>My Childhood Years</em></h2>

    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>During my childhood years</b>, I used to play different toys, imagining that they are really happening in my mind<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. This being said, I felt that I own the world for I can create what I want to happen, such as having a happy ending in that certain imagination<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>. Also, I remember playing <i><b><q>patintero</q></b></i> with my childhood friends, and everytime our team wins, I would feel great happiness within me<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. In addition to this, one of the outside sport I played was badminton wherein I very much enjoyed it since it became one of my hobbies in life<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>. This strength of mine allowed me to be better at it in each and every day due to the opportunities I had together with my siblings and cousins<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>. In those years, I never thought of any problems for I just relished every moment of my childhood<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>. At this time, I was free from stress and anxiety, making me the joyous child in the world<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>. During my childhood days, I began to learn on how to appreciate every things I have in my life, especially the small ones<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>. This is because I know that it is only temporary<sup><strong>9</strong></sup>. In contrary, those small things contribute to having many good memories all throughout my childhood<sup><strong>10</strong></sup>. Another one of my childhood memories is that there are particular times I walk with my grandfather who passed away, it was only the two of us and he always treat me a lollipop<sup><strong>11</strong></sup>. I was always excited whenever we will visit at my grandparents especially my grandfather will take me somewhere I want to go<sup><strong>12</strong></sup>. Every Christmas, the whole family will watch <abbr title= "Christmas on Display"><b>COD</b></abbr> at the Greenhills Shopping Center and have family dinner, the best part is that my parents will buy me a robot toy<sup><strong>13</strong></sup>. I also enjoy the field trips with my classmates, it was really fun because it was my first time to explore the places that are really far with my friends<sup><strong>14</strong></sup>. During our field trip, I enjoyed the moment with my friends at the bus when it was already evening going back to school, it feels like I do not want yet to end that moment<sup><strong>15</strong></sup>. There are also free stuff and food at the factory we visited that makes our field trip more enjoyable<sup><strong>16</strong></sup>. Life was easier when I was a child there were no hectic class schedules, workloads, and problems, only fun and games<sup><strong>17</strong></sup>. I remember having my first <abbr title= "Playstation Portable"><b>PSP</b></abbr>, the graphics are much better and more realistic which was the start of the evolution of games or technology<sup><strong>18</strong></sup>. There was no smartphone that time and internet was not yet very famous to the people that is why I was able to go outside more often playing physical games with my neighbor friends<sup><strong>19</strong></sup>. During my childhood, the chips were not that expensive and it has a free sticker or temporary tattoo that you can put on your skin<sup><strong>20</strong></sup>. I always buy that chip and imagining that I have powers<sup><strong>21</strong></sup>.

    <h2><em>My Teenage Years</em></h2>
    <hr width="15%" size="2" color="burlywood" align="left">
    <div align="justify"> 
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>During my teenage years</b>, I realized that there are so many places to explore and the world is huge<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. It was the start where I became conscious about what other people think of me and where I had my first girlfriend<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>. I really had fun so much during my teenage years because me and my friends had a sleepovers, it was exciting because that was my first sleepover experience<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. I felt that we were brothers living in the same house and joking around<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>. During our sleepover, there was one momemnt that is truly memorable for me and that was the time when we were playing basketball at the rooftop of the condominium and began to rain with lightning<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>. We did not mind nor fear the lightning, we just continue playing basketball, slipping on the floor, and having so much laugh<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>. It was like a dramatic moment that I felt truly alive because we enjoyed every moment of it and there was no one telling us what not to do<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>. We stayed up all night long watching horror movies and went to the convenience store at 3:00 in the morning<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>. I knew that it might not happen again because for sure when we get older, we will now become busy with our lives<sup><strong>9</strong></sup>. Playing basketball was very famous during my teenage years because when it was PE time, our teacher let us have our freeplay and we had money bets against one another so that we can play basketball seriously<sup><strong>10</strong></sup>. Every Friday after class, we go to our friend's condominium to play basketball and after playing we will just chill around for a moment like watching T.V and playing <abbr title= "Playstation 3"><b>PS3</b></abbr><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>. When it was 7pm, we will go outside to eat at the fastfood before going home and they will tell jokes that are really funny<sup><strong>12</strong></sup>. There was number of times that after class, fighting occured outside the school and we watched that every fight<sup><strong>13</strong></sup>. During my teenage years, fighting was really famous in our school and I do not know what was the reason<sup><strong>14</strong></sup>. This is the reason why I became an extrovert person because I saw how beautiful the outside world is when you have true friends with you and to explore new things in life<sup><strong>15</strong></sup>. I also experienced having a girlfriend in my teenage years, I remember the feeling of being inlove with the person and makes you even happier when she loves you back<sup><strong>16</strong></sup>. It was such a unique feeling that I cannot describe it but I have no regrets<sup><strong>17</strong></sup>. During my teenage years, I learned to be somehow independent and not being dependent on my parents all the time<sup><strong>18</strong></sup>. There are also my teachers who became part of my life because they were like my second parents, who gives us life lesson and how they are caring to us so that we can go in the right path towards our future<sup><strong>19</strong></sup>. In our moving up ceremony, this is the time where I had mixed emotions especially we will now have separate lives with different schools<sup><strong>20</strong></sup>. I never thought that I will miss them that much to the point that I do not want yet to go after the moving up ceremony<sup><strong>21</strong></sup>.

    <h2><em>My College Years</em></h2>
    <hr width="15%" size="2" color="burlywood" align="left">
    <div align="justify"> 
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>During my college years</b>, I went to the University of the East because it is one of the famous university that are excellence in IT program<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. Since my college years, we did not have any face to face classes because of the pandemic<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>. So many supposed to be good memories in my college years was wasted and for sure my classmates was thinking the same thing<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. Even if there is pandemic life must go on and should adapt to this new normal<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>. There were advantage and disadvantage during online class in my college years such as you do not need to take a bath before going to class but it is very hassle especially you are only in front of the computer and doing your assignments, you do not enjoy the fresh air outside that helps you to relax<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>. Having online class in college is having the same routine almost everyday and I get to talk to my friends in college only on social media platform<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>. There was one time that I met them but because of the strict restrictions and hectic schedule, we cannot see each other again<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>. I admit online class in College is very hard for me because there is a hands-on activity like hardware that I want to learn but so many opportunities were wasted<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>. I just wish that there would be face to face classes again in college<sup><strong>9</strong></sup>. This pandemic gave me only depression and stress but it also woke me up, it taught me that I should always cherish and appreciate the moment with my family, friends, and classmates<sup><strong>10</strong></sup>. There are no memorable memories during my college years, I only remember having an online class, studying, activities, quizzes, and exams<sup><strong>11</strong></sup>. I am thankful that I enjoyed my classmates or blockmates because they are very positive, energetic, and fun to chat with<sup><strong>12</strong></sup>. It is important for me to make friends in college even in online set-up so that my college years will be somehow memorable<sup><strong>13</strong></sup>. Even if I do not see or talk to them personally, I already have a feeling that they are my second family<sup><strong>14</strong></sup>. Also, I am grateful that I have been able to make friends despite of this pandemic<sup><strong>15</strong></sup>. The professors in my university are also very considerate which makes my college years less stressful and I am sure that they understand our situation<sup><strong>16</strong></sup>. While having my online class, my family here with me makes me comfortable, they always inspire me especially when I am down<sup><strong>17</strong></sup>. When we have free time or vacation in my college years, I always get excited to go outside because I miss going out with my friends<sup><strong>18</strong></sup>. They help me to survive from stress and depression in this time of pandemic<sup><strong>19</strong></sup>. This is also the time that makes me a better and more mature person<sup><strong>20</strong></sup>.

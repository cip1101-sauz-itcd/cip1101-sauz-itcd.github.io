    <h3><em>My Skills</em></h3>
    <hr width="15%" size="2" color="burlywood" align="left">
    <div align="justify"> 
    <p><blockquote><b>My skills</b> are playing basketball and chess<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. It takes time to know one's skills and one day you will realize that it is a precious gift that not everyone has it<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>. My parents and cousin taught me how to play chess<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. At first, it seems boring but when you play chess seriously it was very fun for me and I enjoyed it very much<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>. During my grades 5 years, there was an intramurals in our school and there was a chess contest<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>. I did try it because I want to play with other year level too<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>. It was very challenging because all of them were very hard to compete with but it was unexpected that I beat every single opponent<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>. I did not expect that I will win because I just wanted to have fun and experience playing chess with other people but I became chess champion with a gold medal<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>. That was the day I discovered my skills in playing chess and I really aprreciate the game of chess very much<sup><strong>9</strong></sup>. Another skill that I discover for myself is playing basketball<sup><strong>10</strong></sup>. I also love playing basketball because most in our family play that sport<sup><strong>11</strong></sup>. It was also popular sport that everyone knew<sup><strong>12</strong></sup>. I practiced playing basketball when I was in grade 4 and it was hard when it was your first time to play it<sup><strong>13</strong></sup>. But as I grew older, I got used to playing basketball and became addicted in this sport<sup><strong>14</strong></sup>. I joined up the basketball team every intramurals since grade 6<sup><strong>15</strong></sup>. It was so much fun and until now basketball never gets old for me<sup><strong>16</strong></sup>. I will always enjoy every single moment of it with my friends<sup><strong>17</strong></sup>. Not all everyone can play basketball that is why I am blessed that I have skills in playing basketball<sup><strong>18</strong></sup>. It serves my comfort zone to relieve stress from schoolworks and I can play it everyday with my friends.<sup><strong>19</strong></sup>. Basketball and chess means a lot to me and it gave me good opportunities which I am very thankful for.<sup><strong>20</strong></sup>

    <h3><em>My Hobbies</em></h3>
    <hr width="15%" size="2" color="burlywood" align="left">
    <div align="justify"> 
    <p><blockquote><b>My hobbies</b> are watching anime, reading stories, and playing mobile games<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. Hobbies serves as our comfort zone in which we do when we have free time<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>. My hobbies always save me from bordersome in the house especially this pandemic<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. Watching anime is so satisfying especially when the chapter is amazing<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>. My favorite anime is Naruto and now I am watching Boruto since it is very interesting to watch<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>. I fell inlove watching Naruto because it is not just an anime but it is also an inspiring story that you can learn something new<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>. Naruto showed us that when you have a goal, you must work hard for it and be better everday<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>. It also shows that even if you are nothing today but when you work hard to achieve your goals you can change your stars<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>. My another hobby is reading different stories<sup><strong>9</strong></sup>. When I was also in gradeschool we have this small book full of wonderful stories<sup><strong>10</strong></sup>. I eventually love reading because of this book especially if you are just a child and you have a lot of imagination while reading<sup><strong>11</strong></sup>. Until now I sometimes read that book when I do not have anything to do because it takes me back on how fun is reading stories<sup><strong>12</strong></sup>. I never expected that I would love to read stories and hold books in my hand<sup><strong>13</strong></sup>. My third hobby is playing mobile games<sup><strong>14</strong></sup>. It was very addicting when you play mobile games such as <abbr title= "Mobile Legends"><b>ML</b></abbr> especially when you are bored in the house<sup><strong>15</strong></sup>. I always play seriously in mobile games so that it will be fun and I can enjoy the game<sup><strong>16</strong></sup>. Playing mobile games is also popular especially in this time of pandemic since I cannot play basketball all the time then I play mobile games as an alternative hobby<sup><strong>17</strong></sup>. I never get bored watching anime, read books, and playing mobile games, it helps me to relieve stress<sup><strong>18</strong></sup>. I hope that I can discover more hobbies for myself and enjoy them as much as my other hobbies<sup><strong>19</strong></sup>. Sometimes you also need to enjoy your own companion<sup><strong>20</strong></sup>.

    <h3><em>My Interest</em></h3>
    <hr width="15%" size="2" color="burlywood" align="left">
    <div align="justify"> 
    <p><blockquote><b>My interest</b> is watching new series or movies, travelling in new places, and listening to new and old music<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. Watching new movies and series became my new interest because of Netflix which is very popular especially in this time of pandemic<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>. Almost all movies and series are so interesting to watch, it gives me goosebumps even I watched it already a few times<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. My new interest in Netflix series is All Of Us Are Dead and I enjoyed every episode<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>. I always watch movies and series in Netflix when I do not have anything to do<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>. Sometimes it is very overwhelming and you cannot decide what movies and series you want to watch<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>. The reason why I also became interested in movies and series because there is always new upcoming movies that you will be interested to watch<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>. Travelling to new places is my another interest especially I am very outgoing or extrovert person<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>. I always love to travel with friends and meet new people<sup><strong>9</strong></sup>. Travelling makes me feel relax especially when you are in front of the computer or gadget everyday that someimes gives me a headache<sup><strong>10</strong></sup>. Fresh air is I really need so that I can relax my mind and feel comfortable<sup><strong>11</strong></sup>. I admit that I cannot always stay in my house and not go outside<sup><strong>12</strong></sup>. It is really fun to explore new places and hang out with your friends and I enjoy every moment of it<sup><strong>13</strong></sup>. Listening to music is another thing that interest me<sup><strong>14</strong></sup>. It lifts my mood whenever I am down and it helps me to relax while doing my assignments<sup><strong>15</strong></sup>. Old music brings so much classic vibes in the 19's and it never gets old for me<sup><strong>16</strong></sup>. I also love listening to new music because it has a new taste and I look forward to add new music to my favorites<sup><strong>17</strong></sup>. Music makes my life colorful and lifts up my mood so that I can feel relax and I used it to fall asleep<sup><strong>18</strong></sup>. I sometimes get excited to listen to a new music that I heard from other people<sup><strong>19</strong></sup>. I am positive that I will become interested in other things so that I can experience it and hopefully I can enjoy it<sup><strong>20</strong></sup>.
